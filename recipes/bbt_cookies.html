    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>&emsp; Unless you are allergic or unhealthily obsessed with your weight, you love cookies. This love of cookies has driven many culinary experts, amatuer chefs, and baking hobbyists to search for the <em>Perfect Cookie</em>. The determined chef makes dozens of flavors ranging from M&M chocolate chip to oatmeal raisin. This search, however, usually ends in the chef realizing that ranking cookie flavors is subjective, as most foods are. Few cookies, however, break this barrier of subjectivity to become something more; they become part of the Cookie Hall of Fame.</p>

    <p>&emsp; Brown Butter Toffee Chocolate Chip Cookies, popularized by Alvin Zhou’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1xCU9ydG-A" target="_blank">48-Hour Chocolate Chip Cookies</a> video, are a testament to the fact that hard work produces fine results. The combination of homemade toffee, decadent chocolate, sweetened brown butter, and hours of work produce a cookie which even the pickiest eaters would crave. I challenge anyone, young or old to learn, practice, and perfect this recipe. </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium nonstick saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, brown sugar and salt, stirring until evenly incorporated. If there are grainy lumps or if the fat starts to separate, add a couple splashes of water and stir vigorously to emulsify. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 290°F, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the toffee onto a prepared baking sheet and spread out slightly with a spatula. Freeze until ready to use, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the cookie dough: Add the butter to a medium nonstick saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns dark brown and smells nutty. Watch carefully so the butter does not burn. Remove the pot from the heat.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the granulated and brown sugar, espresso powder, salt and baking soda.</li>
        <li>Pour the brown butter into the sugar mixture and mix until combined. Don’t worry if it looks separated.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolk and vanilla. Pour into the sugar and butter mixture and whisk until glossy and smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and fold with a rubber spatula to incorporate until the dough has no visible flour streaks.</li>
        <li>Remove the toffee from the freezer (it should be a frozen disc) and break it into chunks that will fit inside a gallon zip-top bag. Double bag the toffee and seal both bags. With a rolling pin, break the toffee into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Fold the crushed toffee and chopped chocolate into the dough until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Using a large ice cream scoop or a 1/4 - 1/2 cup (65 gram) measure, scoop the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Wrap the baking sheet in plastic wrap, but leave a small opening at the corner of the tray. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 36 hours. This will allow the flavor to develop and the dough to dry out a little as it rests, which will result in less spread when it bakes. </li>
        <li>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 325°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Arrange the cookies on the baking sheets, leaving at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space between the cookies and away from the edges of the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake until the cookies are golden brown with crispy edges, but are still slightly soft in the center, 18-20 minutes. If cookies are not spreading in a circular shape you can physically shape the cookies by pressing around the edges of the cookie with a knife when they are pulled out of the oven. </li>
        <li>Immediately sprinkle the cookies with flaky sea salt. Let cool completely. The cookies will be very soft at first but will set after they are fully cooled.</li>
    </ol>
