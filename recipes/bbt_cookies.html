    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Unless you are allergic or unhealthily obsessed with your weight, you love cookies. This love of cookies has driven many culinary experts, amatuer chefs, and baking hobbyists to search for the <em>Perfect Cookie</em>. The determined chef makes dozens of flavors ranging from M&M chocolate chip to oatmeal raisin. This search, however, usually ends in the chef realizing that ranking cookie flavors is subjective, as most foods are. Few cookies, however, break this barrier of subjectivity to become something more; they become part of the Cookie Hall of Fame.</p>
    <p>Brown Butter Toffee Chocolate Chip Cookies, popularized by Alvin Zhouâ€™s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1xCU9ydG-A" target="_blank">48-Hour Chocolate Chip Cookies</a> video, are a testament to the fact that hard work produces fine results. The combination of homemade toffee, decadent chocolate, sweetened brown butter, and hours of work produce a cookie which even the pickiest eaters would crave. I challenge anyone, young or old to learn, practice, and perfect this recipe. </p>
